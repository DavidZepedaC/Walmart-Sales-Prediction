# Walmart-Sales-Prediction

Introduction: Linear regression is a data analysis model used to find the relationship between a dependent variable (the one we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (predictors). This model assumes a linear relationship between the variables, making it useful for identifying and quantifying relationships among them, serving as a basic yet powerful tool for data analysis in Python.

Description: In this project, a dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset) is analyzed to predict sales accurately, prudently considering unexpected demands and inventory, as well as a set of available variables.

Requirements: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, tabulate, scikit-learn.
